kakuro_react
============

A Symfony & Reacct project started in 2017

refactor steps:
	switch to semantic
	lose php templates
	upon delete, redirect sommewhere useful
	legend for keyboard shortcuts
	easy way to rename in design mode
	down arrow action on search (standardize in general)
	teaching component - hint gives one morsel only with explanation
	select first data cell by default on load
	keep cell key and solution key in to date -- switch to them exclusively?
	design mode be more helpful
	design mode -- input sums instead of answers. for this you need a new view
	multiple solutions -- cycle thru all, not just 2
